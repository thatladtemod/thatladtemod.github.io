## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned 

When I was styling the QR code I got stuck because the container div was not centering on both axes of the web page. So, here's what i learned;

```css
.container {
        display: flex;
        height: 100vh;
        background: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
      }
```

This is how to center a div.

### Continued development

I would like to continue developing my skills in CSS and understanding the layouts.

### Useful resources

- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

freeCodeCamp helped me with the basics of HTML and CSS.

## Acknowledgments


When I was stuck at the div-centering part of the project, I posted the problem on X (formerly twitter) and on a few Whatsapp groups, the senior developers helped me out. I am really grateful, thank you.
